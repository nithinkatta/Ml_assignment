# Ml_assignment
<p>The Machine Learning project which is assigned by the GDSC(Gooogle Developers Student Club) of VNRVJIET.</p>
<p>The main aim of the project is to find</p>
<ul>
  <li>Accuracy</li>
  <li>Precision</li>
  <li>Sensitivity</li>
  <li>Specificity</li>
  <li>F-Score</li>
  <li>Balanced Score</li>
</ul>
<h1>Importing the packages</h1>
<p>Some of the important packages used to modify the dataset are</p> 
<ol>
  <li>numpy</li>
  <li>pandas</li>
  <li>sklearn</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h1> Performing EDA </h1>
<p> It is the process of modifying the dataset by performing data cleaning and data transformation </p>

<ul>
  <li>The unwanted columns are been removed from the dataset</li>
  <li>Null values are present in the columns are need to be removed</li>
  <li>The string and other type of data column also must be removed which are unnecessay for the data model and to make sure increase the accuracy</li>
  <li>The data type of int and float can be allowed</li>
  <li>Infinite data in the dataset are also need to be removed</li>
</ul>

<h1>Building Model</h1>
<p></p>Here comes the main machine learing model which produces the output based on the given input. The output of the input is generated based on the several training of ml model by giving instructions of input and ouput data </p>
<p>The Model trains and produces the output as user expected</p>

<h4>XGBoost</h4>
<p> It is one of the machine learing model used for scalable and highly accurate implementation of gradient boosting that pushes the limits of computing power for boosted tree algorithm</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p> The overall project is done by inferring the youtube and some formulaes from the google. After gaining the perfect knowledge on correct modification of dataset I started modifying the dataset and accomplished all the tasks mentioned. </p>
